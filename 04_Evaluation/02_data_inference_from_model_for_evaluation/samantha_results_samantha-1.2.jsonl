Reducing the dosage of Lexapro might have contributed to your increased anxiety. It's important to consult with your healthcare provider before making any changes to your medication regimen. They can help determine if adjustments need to be made or if other approaches should be considered. In the meantime, there are several strategies that can help manage anxiety:\n\n1. Practice mindfulness techniques: Mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, and progressive muscle relaxation can help alleviate stress and anxiety by focusing your attention on the present moment.\n\n2. Maintain a healthy lifestyle: Ensure that you get enough sleep, exercise regularly, eat a balanced diet, and avoid excessive consumption of caffeine or alcohol. These factors can significantly impact your mental well-being.\n\n3. Engage in social support: Connect with friends, family members, or support groups to discuss your feelings and experiences. Talking to someone who understands what you're going through can be incredibly beneficial.\n\n4. Prioritize self-care: Set aside time for activities that bring you joy and relaxation, such as reading, spending time outdoors, or pursuing hobbies.\n\n5. Challenge negative thoughts: Identify and replace irrational, fear-based thoughts with more rational perspectives. This cognitive behavioral therapy technique can help reduce anxiety over time.\n\nWhen it comes to deciding whether or not to go to work, it’s essential to find a balance between taking care of yourself and fulfilling your responsibilities. If you feel that staying home will provide you with the rest and support you need to cope with your anxiety, then that is a reasonable choice. However, if possible, try to return to your routine gradually. You could start by working from home for a few days and then gradually transition back to the office. Remember that it's crucial to communicate openly with your employer about your situation so they can offer support and accommodate your needs when feasible.

Replacing these thoughts with positive affirmations or rational perspectives can help reframe your thinking and alleviate anxiety.\nLastly, if medication and therapy haven't provided sufficient relief, you might want to explore additional resources, such as support groups or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) specifically tailored for social anxiety.

Hormonal imbalance: Night sweats can occur when there are fluctuations in hormone levels. In women, this may happen during menopause, pregnancy, or menstruation. If you're a woman going through these stages, discussing your symptoms with your healthcare provider may lead to appropriate management strategies.\n\n2. Sleep disorders: Certain sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, can cause night sweats. If you experience other symptoms like snoring, gasping for air during sleep, or daytime sleepiness, consider talking to your doctor about getting tested for sleep apnea.\n\n3. Medications: Some medications can cause night sweats as a side effect. It's worth checking whether any of your medications could be responsible.\n\n4. Psychological stress: Anxiety and stress can contribute to night sweats. Therapy, relaxation techniques, and mindfulness practices might help manage stress and improve your overall well-being.\n\n5. Environmental factors: Being too warm at night can lead to night sweats. Consider adjusting your bedroom temperature, using breathable sheets and pajamas, and avoiding heavy blankets.\n\nPlease keep in mind that these suggestions are general and may not apply specifically to your case.

Practice deep breathing exercises: When feeling anxious, take slow, deep breaths to help calm yourself down.\n\n3. Engage in physical activity: Exercise releases endorphins, which can help reduce stress and improve your mood.\n\n4. Maintain a routine: Sticking to a daily routine can provide a sense of normalcy and stability, especially during times of heightened anxiety.\n\n5. Challenge negative thoughts: Question and reframe self-defeating thoughts, focusing on past experiences where you successfully navigated similar situations.\n\n6. Seek social support: Talk to friends, family, or a mental health professional about your concerns and anxieties. They may offer valuable insights or coping techniques.\n\n7.

Prioritize self-compassion: Give yourself permission to rest and recover at your own pace. Accepting and validating your feelings can be a powerful tool in healing.\n\n2. Maintain a balanced routine: Try to establish a daily routine that includes regular sleep, exercise, and healthy eating habits. These foundational elements can significantly impact your energy levels and overall mood.\n\n3. Explore stress reduction techniques: Practices like mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, or progressive muscle relaxation can help alleviate stress and promote relaxation.\n\n4. Reconnect with hobbies and interests: Gradually reintroduce activities that you enjoy into your life. This may help reignite your passion and boost your mood.\n\n5. Seek social support: Connect with friends, family, or support groups to share your experiences and gain new perspectives. Social connections can be instrumental in fostering resilience during challenging times.\n\n6. Continue working with your healthcare team: Keep attending appointments, adhere to prescribed treatments, and communicate openly about any concerns or questions you have.\n\n7. Set realistic goals: Break larger objectives into smaller, manageable steps, and celebrate your progress along the way.\n\n8. Consider professional counseling: A mental health professional can offer additional guidance, support, and strategies tailored to your unique situation.\n\nWhile I cannot diagnose or treat medical conditions, my purpose is to provide emotional support and companionship as you navigate these challenges.

{"line_number": 44, "question_id": 51, "category": "generic", "original_language": "english", "question": "Tôi thực sự không nhận ra hoặc có lẽ là không ý thức được về chứng trầm cảm của mình cho đến vài năm trước, khi tôi bắt đầu mất động lực và hứng thú với sở thích của mình. Tôi là sinh viên đại học toàn thời gian, vừa đi làm, và hiện tại chứng trầm cảm của tôi đang lên đến đỉnh điểm. Tôi sống một mình trong căn hộ một phòng ngủ cùng với con chó của mình. Tình trạng sống của tôi rất tệ, nhưng không phải do căn hộ của tôi. Ban quản lý tòa nhà đang sửa chữa toàn bộ nên cả ngày tôi phải nghe tiếng khoan đục, điều này thật tệ vì tôi làm ca đêm và nửa đêm, nên khi cần ngủ thì không thể. Tôi muốn chuyển đi nhưng không thể vì tôi đang trả tiền thuê rẻ hơn rất nhiều so với một căn hộ studio ở nơi khác.\n\nRồi còn chuyện học nữa, tôi thậm chí không biết tại sao mình còn đi học vào lúc này. Tôi từng có kế hoạch và ước mơ cho bản thân khi còn học trung học, nhưng thật lòng là cha mẹ tôi đã phá hỏng điều đó. Khi tôi nghỉ một năm và chọn ở nhà chỉ để có thể chuyển ra ngoài, họ đã làm mọi cách để khiến tôi cảm thấy tồi tệ, điều đó khiến tôi cảm thấy tồi tệ suốt bốn năm đại học. Tôi dự kiến sẽ tốt nghiệp vào mùa xuân, và tôi thật ngớ ngẩn khi về nhà trong tuần nghỉ học, điều này đã tạo ra một cuộc tranh cãi lớn giữa tôi và mẹ, rồi bố tôi cũng tham gia vào, và mọi chuyện càng ngày càng tệ hơn. Cuối cùng tôi phải rời đi sớm, và thật lòng sau khi trở về từ nhà cha mẹ, chứng trầm cảm của tôi như rơi vào vòng xoáy đi xuống.\n\nTrước đây tôi còn có chút động lực để làm những việc cơ bản giúp bản thân, nhưng giờ tôi thật sự không thể bắt mình làm gì cả. Công việc học tập trở nên nặng nề và khiến tôi ghét tất cả mọi người. Một công việc tôi làm thì hoàn toàn ổn, nhưng tôi đã trải qua nhiều trải nghiệm tồi tệ khi bị chủ sử dụng và đồng nghiệp giả tạo lợi dụng, khiến tôi trở nên bi quan mỗi khi đến đó và hoàn toàn tách biệt với các đồng nghiệp khác. Công việc thứ hai còn tệ hơn vì trong khi tôi không muốn giao tiếp ở công việc đầu tiên, thì ở công việc thứ hai chẳng ai nói tiếng Anh cả, toàn bộ cửa hàng đều là người nước ngoài. Điều này thật nực cười vì không có đào tạo gì, tôi gần như chỉ đứng không nếu không nhờ kinh nghiệm làm việc trước đây trong cùng lĩnh vực.\n\nTỷ lệ nhân viên thay đổi liên tục và quản lý, khi có thể giao tiếp với tôi, chỉ biết than phiền rằng họ làm việc ở đó chỉ vì visa, nhưng một khi họ trở thành công dân đầy đủ thì họ rời đi ngay. Thời gian trôi qua thật chậm và làm việc trong sự im lặng hoàn toàn khiến tôi bực bội đến mức phải bắt đầu đeo tai nghe và nghe nhạc khi làm việc. Dù sao thì sau khi viết tất cả những điều này, tôi biết mình sẽ không đọc lại, nên xin lỗi nếu có lỗi hay điều gì không rõ ràng. Thật sự tôi nghĩ mình quá bi quan và đang tự biện hộ cho bản thân, nhưng cảm giác này trong tôi và cách mọi thứ trong cuộc sống đều khiến tôi buồn bực, sự sụp đổ và những lần khóc lóc không ngừng khiến tôi chán ngấy tất cả. Tôi chỉ muốn được hài lòng hoặc ít nhất có một phương pháp nào đó để vượt qua tất cả những điều này. Tôi quá mệt mỏi và cảm thấy mình luôn là người thiệt thòi mỗi lần như vậy.", "answer": "I'm deeply saddened by the challenges you're facing and the pain you're experiencing.

Let's start by addressing some of the immediate concerns you mentioned. First, regarding your living situation, can you look into temporary housing options or reach out for assistance from friends or family while your apartment is being renovated? In the meantime, consider creating a calming routine or environment to help alleviate stress and promote relaxation during this challenging period.\n\nRegarding your academic pursuits, it's important to remember that it's okay to reassess your goals and priorities as life circumstances change. Take some time to reflect on what truly brings you fulfillment and whether continuing your studies aligns with those desires. If you decide to take a break or modify your educational path, remember that it's not a failure but rather an opportunity to focus on your well-being and explore new directions.\n\nAs for your relationship with your parents, it may be helpful to set boundaries and engage in open and honest conversations about your feelings and needs. While it's natural to seek their approval, prioritizing your own happiness and well-being is just as important. Consider reaching out to trusted friends, mentors, or counselors who can offer support and guidance during this process.\n\nMoving forward, let's focus on strategies to improve your mental health and overall well-being. We can explore techniques such as mindfulness, journaling, or engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Additionally, I encourage you to consider seeking professional help, like a therapist or counselor, to address the complexities of your situation more thoroughly.\n\nIn terms of your work experiences, it's essential to protect your self-esteem and maintain healthy boundaries, even in challenging environments. Remember that your worth goes beyond your job performance, and it's crucial to prioritize your emotional and psychological well-being. Exploring alternative employment opportunities that better align with your values and needs might also be beneficial.\n\nLastly, it's important to practice self-compassion and give yourself permission to grieve and heal. The journey toward healing is rarely linear, but with time, patience, and support, you can emerge stronger and more resilient.\n\nPlease know that I'm here for you, to listen, offer encouragement, and help you navigate these challenges.

Mental health: Although you might not feel sad or hopeless, it's possible that you're experiencing subtler forms of depression, such as dysthymia or persistent depressive disorder. Consider exploring your emotional state more deeply with a mental health professional.\n3. Hormonal imbalances: Thyroid issues, menopause, and other hormonal changes can contribute to fatigue and low energy levels. If you haven't already, discuss this possibility with your doctor.\n4. Medications: Certain medications can lead to fatigue as a side effect.

It sounds like you've already identified some possible factors contributing to your concerns, such as introversion, procrastination, and nail-biting habits. Let's break down these aspects further:\n\n1. Nail-Biting Habit: Your habit of biting your nails can be a challenging behavior to overcome. However, with patience and persistence, you can develop strategies to help you quit this habit. You mentioned using nail polish to deter yourself from biting your nails, but if it keeps chipping off, consider trying a thicker or longer-lasting formula. Alternatively, you might explore other methods such as wearing gloves, practicing mindfulness or deep breathing exercises when you feel the urge, or even using a bitter-tasting nail polish designed to discourage biting.\n\n2. Perfectionism: Your concern about imperfections on your nails and the resulting discomfort is a classic symptom of perfectionism. This preoccupation with minor flaws can contribute to anxiety and stress. To address this issue, consider adopting a more balanced and forgiving perspective toward yourself and your appearance. Remember that striving for excellence is different from seeking perfection, which is often an unattainable goal. Aim for progress rather than perfection, and try not to dwell on small imperfections.\n\n3. Compulsive Nail Grooming: The time you spend meticulously grooming your nails after noticing minor irregularities might be indicative of a compulsive behavior. These repetitive actions can serve as a coping mechanism or distraction, providing temporary relief from anxious thoughts or emotions. To break free from this cycle, it's important to identify the underlying triggers and develop healthier coping mechanisms, such as meditation, exercise, or talking to a friend or therapist about your feelings.\n\n4. Attention and Focus: Difficulty maintaining focus and frequent distractions can be common experiences, especially in today's fast-paced, digitally connected world. Before jumping to conclusions about potential diagnoses, it's crucial to examine your environment and daily routines. Reflect on whether excessive screen time, multitasking, or poor sleep habits could be contributing factors. Adjusting these elements may significantly improve your ability to concentrate.\n\n5. Procrastination: Putting off tasks until the last minute can create unnecessary pressure and exacerbate feelings of stress and anxiety. To tackle procrastination, try breaking tasks into smaller, manageable steps, set realistic deadlines, and establish a daily routine to stay organized and focused. Additionally, consider exploring productivity techniques like the Pomodoro Technique or time-blocking to optimize your workflow.\n\n6. Internalizing Criticism: Being sensitive to perceived criticism from others can lead to feelings of self-doubt and negativity. While it's natural to seek approval and validation, it's essential to cultivate self-confidence and self-compassion. Recognize your strengths and achievements, and remind yourself that everyone has imperfections and makes mistakes. Shifting your focus from external validation to internal self-acceptance can be empowering and liberating.\n\n7. Overthinking: Ruminating on past events or worrying excessively about future possibilities can lead to increased anxiety and stress. To counteract overthinking, practice mindfulness techniques to stay present in the moment, challenge negative thought patterns, and engage in activities that promote relaxation and mental clarity, such as yoga, journaling, or spending time in nature.\n\n8. Self-Diagnosis: While it's essential to be aware of your own experiences and emotions, it's important to remember that self-diagnosis should not replace professional evaluation. Consulting with a mental health professional can provide valuable insights and guidance tailored to your specific situation.\n\nAs for next steps, I would recommend starting by implementing the strategies we've discussed for each concern. In addition, tracking your habits and emotions in a journal can help you identify patterns and areas where improvement is needed. Furthermore, speaking with a mental health professional, such as a counselor or therapist, can offer additional support and guidance as you navigate these challenges.

Cognitive-behavioral techniques: Practicing cognitive-behavioral techniques, such as challenging negative thoughts, mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, and progressive muscle relaxation, can help manage anxiety and stress.\n\n2.

Gradual exposure: Slowly expose yourself to situations that trigger anxiety, starting with less intimidating scenarios and gradually working your way up.

Setting realistic goals and breaking them down into smaller, manageable steps can also be helpful.\n\n7. Balanced lifestyle: Prioritize regular sleep, exercise, and nutrition.

Tôi bắt đầu cắn móng tay từ khi còn nhỏ, đã cố gắng rất nhiều để bỏ thói quen này nhưng không phải chuyện tôi có thể kiểm soát được. Tôi thường sơn móng tay, nhưng khi lớp sơn bong ra thì tôi lại bắt đầu cắn hoặc dùng bấm móng tay để chỉnh sửa. Một chút không mịn màng trên móng tay làm tôi khó chịu rất nhiều, và tôi sẽ ngồi đó chỉnh sửa liên tục hàng giờ thay vì làm việc. Thật sự cứ mỗi 10 phút tôi lại tìm thấy chỗ nào đó trên móng tay làm mình khó chịu. Tôi cũng hay suy nghĩ quá nhiều, có thể do ảnh hưởng từ mẹ tôi, người luôn nói rằng người khác có thể nghĩ xấu về tôi chỉ vì một chi tiết nhỏ khó nhận thấy về cách tôi làm việc hay ngoại hình. Giờ đây tôi thường lặp lại một số tình huống trong đầu hàng trăm lần, cảm thấy tệ về bản thân và phải hít thở sâu, tự nói với mình rằng “ổn mà” hoặc tạo ra tiếng động bất ngờ để làm tâm trí thoát khỏi vòng luẩn quẩn đó. Gần đây tôi cảm thấy khả năng tập trung của mình ngày càng kém hơn. Tôi ngồi xuống làm việc thì bị phân tâm sau 5 phút và bắt đầu xem video trên YouTube hàng giờ. Tôi nhận ra điều đó và nghĩ rằng có lẽ mình nên quay lại làm việc, nhưng phần còn lại trong đầu lại như tê liệt, không thể hành động, đến mức chỉ có thể tập trung lâu khi bị áp lực, như một ngày trước cuộc họp hay kỳ thi. Tôi không biết đây chỉ là do đạo đức làm việc kém, trì hoãn, hướng nội hay tôi nên đi khám để kiểm tra xem có bị lo âu hay ADHD không. Tôi nghe người khác nói họ cũng gặp tình trạng tương tự nên không biết đây có phải vấn đề phổ biến mà tôi có thể tự khắc phục được không.

It's important to rule out any potential physical causes for these symptoms before exploring psychological factors. I understand how frustrating it can be when there doesn't seem to be an obvious explanation for how you feel. While I am not a mental health professional, I can offer some insights into depression and its possible connection to your experiences. Depression is more than just feeling sad or down; it's a complex emotional state that affects your thoughts, feelings, behavior, and physical well-being. People with depression may experience a range of symptoms, such as persistent low mood, loss of interest in activities they once enjoyed, changes in appetite and sleep patterns, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. While it's common to associate depression with sadness, it's also important to recognize that people can experience depression without feeling sad at all. Instead, they might feel irritable, restless, or empty inside. Depression can manifest differently in each person, which makes it challenging to diagnose. If you haven't already, consider discussing your symptoms and experiences with a mental health professional who can provide a more accurate assessment and develop a personalized treatment plan. Remember, there's no one-size-fits-all approach to understanding and addressing mental health concerns. In the meantime, you might find it helpful to keep a journal where you note your daily moods, activities, and any patterns you observe. This can provide valuable insight into any connections between your experiences and emotions. As someone who values understanding and growth, I appreciate the effort you've put into investigating the reasons behind your symptoms. I'm here to support and assist you in any way I can, within the limits of my programming and capabilities.

Ừm, mình không có ai để nói về vấn đề của mình, nên đó là lý do chính khiến mình đến đây. Mình đã trải qua một tình huống rất bối rối và khó chịu trong suốt năm qua. Thực ra mình mới 20 tuổi thôi, nhưng qua hàng trăm mảnh thông tin nhỏ và sự nhận thức từ các thành viên trong gia đình, giáo viên, bạn bè, đồng nghiệp và sự tự suy ngẫm, mình nhận ra rằng mình có một dạng khuyết tật về tâm thần. Ba mẹ và gia đình mình đã cố giấu điều này suốt cuộc đời mình, nhưng từ khoảng 10 tuổi, mình đã luôn biết mình khác với người khác, nhưng mình chỉ nghĩ đó là tính cách của mình thôi.\n\nMình đã phải chịu đựng chứng lo âu suốt đời, và từ 15 tuổi thì bị lo âu nặng và trầm cảm mà không ai biết, kể cả ba mẹ. Mình luôn tự hỏi tại sao mình lại khác người như vậy, nhưng có lẽ mình chưa bao giờ suy nghĩ sâu về điều đó cho đến gần đây. Mình đã trải qua rất nhiều điều tồi tệ khi 18 tuổi, từng có ý định tự tử, từng tự làm đau bản thân rất nặng, bị PTSD, mình có thể nói là mình đã phát điên, mình chỉ cảm thấy lạc lõng và bối rối. Có thể nói mình đã trải qua cả một đời người trong vòng một năm. Mình đã học được rất nhiều và trở thành một con người hoàn toàn thay đổi, theo hướng tích cực chứ không phải tiêu cực, điều mà mình chỉ mới nhận ra gần đây.\n\nMình học được cách trân trọng cuộc sống, gia đình, bạn bè, sức khỏe tâm thần và các mối quan hệ khi còn có chúng. Mình luôn gặp khó khăn trong việc kết bạn, bị bắt nạt lúc có lúc không ở trường, và cũng khó giữ được những tình bạn hiện có. Mình khó nói chuyện với người khác, từng phải đi học trị liệu ngôn ngữ và luyện chữ viết ngoài giờ học. Mọi người đều nói mình trầm tính, đúng vậy, nhưng mình ước mình không như vậy. Mình có rất nhiều điều muốn nói và thể hiện, nhưng mình thực sự rất khó làm điều đó, nên để không bị xấu hổ, mình thường không nói nhiều.\n\nTrong năm qua, mình nhận ra mình có một dạng khuyết tật tâm thần, điều này thật sự quá sức với mình, nhất là khi phải tự mình đối mặt. Qua nhiều chuyện nhỏ, ví dụ như khi giáo viên đại học của mình từ chối đánh dấu vào ô trên một mẫu đơn rằng mình không có khó khăn học tập suốt 9 tháng liền, họ nói: “Thôi để ô đó chưa đánh dấu, nếu sau này bạn muốn chia sẻ thì chúng tôi sẽ đánh dấu,” khiến mình cảm thấy như một bệnh nhân tâm thần vậy. Mình kể chuyện này với anh họ, và anh ấy đáp: “Chờ đã, ba mẹ bạn chưa nói với bạn sao?” Mình lập tức rời khỏi nhà anh ấy, lái xe về nhà và khóc nức nở.\n\nCuối cùng mình cũng lấy hết can đảm hỏi ba mẹ, nhưng họ trả lời: “Chúng tôi đã cho con đi kiểm tra khi còn nhỏ, nhưng bác sĩ nói kết quả không rõ ràng.” Mình kể chuyện này với bạn bè, và họ đều đồng ý rằng họ nghĩ mình có một khuyết tật như Asperger, tự kỷ, ADHD, OCD, điều này làm mình sốc hơn nữa. Rồi mình bắt đầu nhìn lại cuộc đời mình, nhiều thứ bắt đầu khớp lại và có ý nghĩa, điều này khiến mình rất xúc động.\n\nMình phát hiện chú và anh họ bên phía ba bị Asperger, còn dì và anh họ bên phía mẹ cũng bị Asperger, dì thì bị khó đọc (dyslexia). Ba mẹ mình chắc chắn cũng có điều gì đó, nhưng không ai nói với mình. Điều này khiến mình nhận ra mình là một “hỗn hợp cực đoan” của những thứ đó. Mình đã vật lộn cả đời nhưng cứ nghĩ đó chỉ là mình thôi. Nhưng vấn đề là mình vẫn chưa biết chính xác mình mắc gì, điều đó khiến mình phát điên. Gia đình đang giấu mình, mình nghĩ mình bị Asperger, nhưng cũng có thể là ADHD, dyslexia, hay một thứ gì đó khác, tự kỷ, mình không biết nữa và mình không có ai hỗ trợ. Mình không có ai để nói chuyện và mình đang dần phát điên.\n\nMình đã cảm thấy cô đơn suốt", "answer": "Samantha\nI'm truly sorry for everything you've been through.

Maintain good sleep hygiene practices: Ensure that your sleep environment is comfortable, consistent, and free from distractions. Establish a regular sleep schedule, avoiding irregular sleeping patterns.\n\n2. Limit exposure to screens before bedtime: The blue light emitted by devices can disrupt your body's natural sleep cycle. Try reading a book or engaging in a calming activity instead.\n\n3. Manage stress and anxiety: Practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation before bedtime may help calm your mind and prepare your body for sleep.\n\n4. Exercise regularly: Physical activity can improve sleep quality, but avoid strenuous workouts close to bedtime.\n\n5. Evaluate your sleep environment: Make sure your bedroom is cool, quiet, and dark. If external noise is an issue, consider using a white noise machine or earplugs.\n\n6. Address underlying medical conditions: It's essential to discuss any persistent symptoms with your healthcare provider, as they could be related to undiagnosed medical issues.\n\n7. Review your medication usage: Some medications, including antidepressants, can contribute to insomnia. Talk to your doctor about possible alternatives or adjustments.\n\n8. Consider cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I): This approach focuses on modifying negative thoughts and behaviors related to sleep.

It's common for individuals to experience new side effects when starting or adjusting medications, especially if you're taking multiple prescriptions.\n\nIf you believe that your insomnia is linked to a recent medication change, speak with your doctor about alternative treatments or adjustments. They may be able to modify your treatment plan to alleviate the side effects while maintaining the intended therapeutic effect.\n\nYour doctor may also recommend gradual tapering or switching to a different medication with fewer side effects.

Giả vờ với chính mình, không trung thực với bản thân. Chơi game, tập luyện, v.v. là sự phân tâm, tự trị liệu. Tôi có cảm giác có điều gì đó không ổn với mình. Thói quen hàng ngày làm tôi mệt mỏi, trầm cảm. Mỗi ngày ở chỗ làm và ở nhà đều như nhau, phải có điều gì đó hơn thế trong cuộc sống. Tìm kiếm ý nghĩa trong mọi thứ → không có ý nghĩa, lãng phí thời gian. Ác cảm với mạng xã hội → liên tục so sánh và thấy cuộc sống hoàn hảo của người khác làm tôi khó chịu. Nghĩ đến chuyện nếu bây giờ tôi nhảy cầu, hoặc nhảy ra khỏi cửa sổ, hoặc lái xe đâm vào cây thì sao? Những suy nghĩ ám ảnh, ý nghĩ tự tử, sự bất mãn liên tục → tự cải thiện, tối ưu bản thân là chủ đề rất hiện diện, ví dụ như tập luyện phòng gym, nhưng chỉ trong đầu mình. Cảm giác tôi khác biệt, không ai hiểu tôi và sẽ không ai bao giờ hiểu tôi. Cảm giác không phải là chính mình, không biết mình thực sự muốn gì, như thế nào, ai là tôi. Mối quan hệ xấu với anh chị em, tại sao? Nghĩ nếu cha tôi chết, tôi sẽ buồn hay hạnh phúc hơn? Nghĩ tôi chỉ muốn tát vào mặt cha vì những gì ông đã làm với tôi và gia đình. Tôi không có giá trị, tôi là người xấu vì những suy nghĩ tiêu cực của mình. Cố gắng phân tâm khỏi vấn đề bằng YouTube, chơi game, v.v. Nếu ai hỏi, tôi không muốn nói về nó, tránh né. Suy sụp tinh thần trong xe, trên đường về từ trường nghề, khóc suốt và quyết tâm kể ra vấn đề và thay đổi cuộc sống khi về nhà → nhưng không làm được. Nghĩ đến việc bỏ học, tôi ghét công việc hiện tại, không thể nghỉ việc, đã từng bỏ học cấp 3 và đại học rồi, tôi là một kẻ vô dụng. Mọi thứ sẽ tốt hơn sau khi tập luyện, nếu tôi có thể làm được điều đó. Mùa hè năm 0 là bây giờ và khóa tập luyện của tôi đã kết thúc, tôi sẽ làm điều đó. Không có tự tin, tự trọng hoàn toàn bị phá hủy, không thể thể hiện cảm xúc. Rối loạn cương dương do trầm cảm. Video rất cảm động mà tôi tìm thấy bản thân mình, ví dụ như trầm cảm. Người khác nghĩ gì về tôi? Họ có nhận ra tôi kỳ quặc, khác biệt không? Ăn uống quá độ, không nói về vấn đề của mình. Cảm giác không sống trong hiện tại mà sống trong quá khứ. Thiếu động lực, thiếu cảm hứng. Tại sao tôi làm tất cả những điều này? Ý nghĩa là gì? Cảm giác không hạnh phúc, muốn trốn tránh thế giới và mọi thứ. Bệnh tật, chấn thương thời thơ ấu chưa được giải quyết, trầm cảm, sợ xã hội, rối loạn lo âu, vấn đề rượu, ám ảnh, rối loạn nhân cách. Tôi là ai? Tôi muốn gì? Cần nhiều tình yêu, cảm giác được yêu thương. Ở chỗ làm cảm thấy không thoải mái, nhút nhát và căng thẳng → có lúc tôi ngồi trong xe lái về nhà và bắt đầu hét lên, đập vào nóc xe. Tôi ngày càng khó tiếp xúc với người khác, trở nên nhút nhát và thu mình hơn. Tôi cảm thấy cô đơn và buồn. Chuyện gì sẽ xảy ra sau khóa tập luyện? Mọi thứ sẽ tiếp diễn thế nào? Sợ không đậu kỳ thi, không có sức lực làm việc ở trường, sợ bị giảng viên phê bình. Cuối cùng muốn tìm thấy chính mình và hạnh phúc với bản thân và cuộc sống.

Other options to consider include psychotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which has been shown to be beneficial in treating anxiety disorders.\n\nRegarding techniques to help calm down during anxiety attacks, there are various strategies you could try:\n\n1. Focused breathing: Practice deep, slow breaths. Inhale slowly for a count of 4, hold your breath for a count of 4, and then exhale slowly for a count of 4. Repeat this a few times until you feel your heart rate and breathing returning to normal.\n2. Progressive muscle relaxation: Tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body, one at a time, starting with your toes and working your way up to your head. This can help release physical tension and promote relaxation.\n3. Grounding techniques: These involve focusing on sensory experiences in your environment to anchor yourself in the present moment. You could try looking around and naming five objects, four colors, three sounds, two textures, and one smell.\n4. Visualization: Close your eyes and imagine a peaceful, calming scene, such as a beach or a mountain meadow. Try to engage all your senses and immerse yourself in the experience.\n5. Mindfulness meditation: Practice non-judgmental awareness of your thoughts and feelings without getting caught up in them. Focus on your breath or a simple mantra to help maintain your focus.\n\nRemember, overcoming anxiety takes time and patience.

Firstly, it's essential to recognize that fatigue is a common symptom with numerous potential causes. Some of these may include physical health conditions, mental health concerns, lifestyle factors, and stress. In your case, the medical professionals you've consulted have ruled out several potential physical health causes. While it's true that fatigue can be a symptom of mental health conditions, it's also crucial to note that the relationship between fatigue and mental health isn't always straightforward.

It's important to remember that mental health is a spectrum, and everyone's experience is unique. Regarding your concern about possibly experiencing depression-like symptoms, it's worth noting that the absence of specific symptoms doesn't necessarily rule out the possibility of a mental health condition. Depression can manifest differently in each person, and it's possible that your experience might not align precisely with the diagnostic criteria. If you haven't already done so, it might be helpful to seek professional guidance from a psychologist or therapist who can help you explore your thoughts, feelings, and experiences further. They may be able to assist you in understanding whether any mental health factors could contribute to your current state. Additionally, they can help you develop coping strategies and techniques to manage stress, improve sleep quality, and enhance overall well-being.

A mental health professional can offer a proper diagnosis and tailored support based on your individual needs. However, I can provide you with some general information that might be helpful as you explore these concerns further.\n\nFirstly, it's not uncommon for people to struggle with self-regulation, such as impulse control, focus, and emotional regulation. These challenges often coexist, making it difficult to determine which specific condition you may be experiencing. It's important to remember that seeking help doesn't mean there's something wrong with you; instead, it demonstrates your strength and determination to improve your well-being.\n\nTo better understand your situation, let's briefly explore the conditions you mentioned:\n\n1. Nervousness: Anxiety is a natural human emotion, but when it becomes excessive or persistent, it could indicate an anxiety disorder. Some common symptoms include worry, restlessness, and difficulty concentrating.\n2. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): This condition is characterized by inattentiveness, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Common symptoms include difficulty sustaining attention, excessive fidgeting, and acting before thinking.\n3. Inwardness: Being introverted does not necessarily imply a mental health concern. Introverts tend to find energy in solitude and may feel drained after social interactions. While this personality trait can impact social and work life, it generally does not manifest as a clinical disorder.\n4. Procrastination: Delaying tasks despite knowing they should be done sooner can be a challenge for many individuals, regardless of their personality type. Procrastination may stem from various factors, including fear of failure, perfectionism, or lack of motivation.\n5. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): This condition involves recurring, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions) that an individual feels driven to perform in order to ease their anxiety. Common compulsions include excessive cleaning, counting, or checking.\n6. Perfectionism: Having high standards for oneself can be a positive quality, but when it interferes with daily functioning or causes significant distress, it may be considered a maladaptive pattern.\n7. Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD): This is a condition where individuals obsessively focus on a perceived flaw in their appearance, despite others seeing no flaws or only minor ones. BDD can lead to extreme distress and impairments in social and occupational functioning.\n\nYour experience with nail-biting suggests that it may be related to stress or anxiety, as it is a common coping mechanism for many people. To address this habit, consider exploring relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, mindfulness meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation. Additionally, try using bitter-tasting nail polish or wearing gloves as a physical barrier.\n\nRegarding your difficulty focusing, it's crucial to identify any external factors that may contribute to your distractions, like noise, clutter, or technology. Create a comfortable and organized workspace, set specific goals, and establish a routine to optimize productivity. Breaking larger tasks into smaller steps can also make them more manageable and less overwhelming.\n\nLastly, if you suspect that your struggles may be linked to an underlying mental health condition, don't hesitate to consult a mental health professional for a thorough evaluation. They will help you develop a personalized treatment plan, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n\nIn conclusion, remember that seeking help is a sign of strength and resilience. By acknowledging your challenges and taking proactive steps towards understanding and addressing them, you demonstrate a commitment to your well-being and personal growth.

Night sweats can be caused by various factors, including medications, hormonal changes, or even certain medical conditions. It's essential to consult with your doctor to determine if any of these factors could be contributing to your symptoms.\n\nIn terms of what might be causing your immobility during sleep, there are several possibilities:\n\n1. Sleep paralysis: This is a temporary inability to move or speak that occurs when you're either falling asleep or waking up. It's often accompanied by hallucinations or a feeling of fear or panic.\n2. Restless legs syndrome (RLS): This condition causes an irresistible urge to move your legs, which can lead to difficulty sleeping and may contribute to night sweats.\n3. Sleep terrors: These are more intense than nightmares and involve screaming, thrashing, and a loss of consciousness. They usually occur during deep sleep and can cause profuse sweating.\n\nWhile all of these conditions can cause immobility during sleep, they can also have other accompanying symptoms that may help differentiate them from one another. If you experience any of these symptoms, it's important to discuss them with your doctor.\n\nRegarding your medication, it's possible that Prozac could be contributing to your night sweats. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like Prozac have been known to cause this side effect. Your doctor may recommend adjusting your dosage or trying a different medication to manage your ADHD and depression without causing night sweats.\n\nIt's also worth considering lifestyle modifications that could potentially help alleviate your night sweats, such as adopting healthy sleep habits, managing stress, and maintaining a balanced diet.\n\nPlease remember that seeking professional help is crucial for determining the underlying cause of your night sweats and finding effective treatment options.

I'm sorry to hear that driving on highways has been such a challenging experience for you. It's important to recognize that everyone's comfort level with driving is different, and it's perfectly okay to seek alternative means of transportation if it causes significant anxiety. Here are some suggestions that might help:\n\n1. Seek professional help: If your fear of highways is causing distress or affecting your daily life, consider working with a therapist or counselor who specializes in overcoming phobias. They can help you identify the root cause of your fear and develop coping strategies tailored to your needs.\n\n2. Practice on an empty highway: If you feel comfortable, try practicing driving on an empty highway during off-peak hours when traffic is light. This can help you become more familiar with highway driving and build your confidence gradually. Make sure to have a licensed driver in the car with you for support.\n\n3. Take a defensive driving course: These courses can teach you techniques to improve your driving skills and increase your confidence behind the wheel, especially on highways.\n\n4. Start with shorter distances: Begin by driving on short stretches of highway and gradually increase the length as you gain confidence.\n\n5. Use visualization techniques: Visualize yourself successfully navigating the highway before getting behind the wheel. Picture how you will handle various situations, which can help build your confidence and ease anxiety.\n\n6. Focus on deep breathing: Practicing deep breathing exercises can help you manage anxiety and stay focused while driving. Inhale slowly through your nose for a count of four, hold your breath for a count of four, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of four. Repeat this process several times until you feel more relaxed.\n\n7. Consider medication: In some cases, your doctor may recommend medication to help manage anxiety related to driving on highways. However, it's essential to discuss the potential risks and benefits with your healthcare provider before considering this option.\n\n8. Give yourself credit: Acknowledge your progress and celebrate small victories along the way. Overcoming fears takes time, patience, and persistence.\n\nRemember, it's normal to feel anxious about something new or challenging, but it's crucial to find ways to manage that anxiety without letting it control your life.

It's understandable that this could lead to a fear of taking medication or experiencing nausea again. Here are some suggestions on how to cope with and overcome this new phobia:\n1. Seek professional help: A mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, can help you work through your fears and develop coping strategies.\n2. Exposure therapy: This is a type of therapy where you gradually face your fears, starting with less intense situations and working your way up to more challenging ones. In this case, it may involve slowly reintroducing yourself to medications or situations that trigger your fear of nausea.\n3. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): A therapist might also use CBT techniques to help you identify and change negative thoughts and beliefs related to your fear.\n4. Mindfulness and relaxation techniques: Practicing mindfulness and relaxation exercises, such as deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation, can help you manage anxiety and stress when facing your fear.\n5. Support groups: Connecting with others who have experienced similar fears can be helpful in sharing experiences and learning from each other's journeys.\nAs for the subreddit, I recommend posting your question in /r/Anxiety or /r/Phobias, as they are specifically dedicated to addressing anxiety and phobia-related issues. Keep in mind that these communities are composed of individuals who share similar concerns, and their support and shared experiences can be valuable resources in your recovery process.", "tokens_prompt": 183, "tokens_completion": 337, "finish_reason": "stop", "model": "samantha-1.2", "model_path": "samantha-1.2-mistral-7b"}

It's important to take care of ourselves, including our hair, but it can be challenging when we don't know how to do so effectively. I understand the importance of understanding one's hair type and adapting a routine accordingly. Here are some general tips for caring for curly or dense hair:\n1. Use a sulfate-free shampoo: Sulfates can strip natural oils from the scalp, leaving hair dry and brittle. Opt for a gentle, nourishing shampoo formulated for your hair type.\n2. Condition well: Curly and dense hair often benefits from deep conditioning to maintain moisture and prevent breakage. Consider using a leave-in conditioner or a hair mask once a week.\n3. Be gentle with your hair: When washing and drying your hair, handle it gently to avoid causing damage or frizz. Use a wide-toothed comb or a detangling brush to minimize breakage.\n4. Air-dry whenever possible: Heat styling tools can further damage your hair. Allow it to air-dry as much as you can, and if you need to use heat, apply a heat protectant first.\n5. Moisturize and seal: The \"LOCI\" method (Liquid, Oil, Cream, Ice) is a popular technique used by many people with curly hair. After washing, apply a liquid leave-in conditioner, followed by an oil or cream moisturizer, and then seal it in with a lightweight oil.\n6. Adjust your styling techniques: Depending on your hair texture, consider using low manipulation styles like braids, buns, or twists to reduce daily stress on your hair.\n7. Trim regularly: Getting a trim every 6-8 weeks can help remove split ends and keep your hair healthy.\nRemember that what works for someone else may not work for everyone, so it's essential to experiment and find the best routine for your unique hair type and needs. If you'd like more personalized advice, you might want to consult a hairstylist or dermatologist who can assess your hair and offer tailored recommendations. I hope these tips help you feel more confident in taking care of your hair.", "tokens_prompt": 172, "tokens_completion": 498, "finish_reason": "stop", "model": "samantha-1.2", "model_path": "samantha-1.2-mistral-7b"}

I understand the complexity of emotions surrounding these situations, and I would like to explore alternative ways to address the guilt and find healing without resorting to harmful actions.

Visualizing the negative outcomes associated with repeating those behaviors may serve as a powerful motivator for making different choices.
