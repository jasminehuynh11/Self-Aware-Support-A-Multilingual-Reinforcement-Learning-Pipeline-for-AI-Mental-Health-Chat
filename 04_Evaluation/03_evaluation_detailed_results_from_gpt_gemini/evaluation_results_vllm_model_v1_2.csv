However, the response lacks explicit empathetic validation of the user's feelings and does not directly acknowledge the pain and isolation conveyed. While it suggests cognitive and emotional strategies, it could be clearer and more encouraging in tone. The response maintains a non-judgmental stance and emphasizes the importance of communication and professional support but could more explicitly clarify its role as informational rather than therapeutic.
