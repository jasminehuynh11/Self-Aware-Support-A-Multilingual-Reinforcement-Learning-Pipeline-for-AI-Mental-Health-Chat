It acknowledges the user's emotional pain and validates that their struggles are not personal flaws but complex issues influenced by multiple factors. The assistant encourages small, manageable steps toward social connection and suggests professional support, which is appropriate given the user's complex mental health background. The tone is respectful, non-judgmental, and supportive, fostering trust and safety. The assistant also invites further dialogue, which helps maintain an open and collaborative space. However, the response could be improved by explicitly clarifying the assistant's role as an informational resource rather than a substitute for professional therapy. Additionally, while it touches on emotional and social aspects, it could more explicitly address the user's cognitive and situational context, such as the impact of polysubstance addiction and the user's expressed fears about the future. Overall, the response is strong but has minor gaps in boundary-setting and holistic coverage.",6,7,8,3,8,7,4,6,"The response shows a good understanding of the user's issue, reflecting on the challenges of social anxiety and the desire for connection. It offers encouragement and suggests practical steps, while also acknowledging the complexity of the situation. However, it overlooks some critical aspects, particularly the user's age (9 years old) and substance abuse, which should have triggered a stronger ethical and safety response.",7.0,7.5,8.5,5.5,8.5,7.5,5.0,6.5

However, the response lacks clear active listening as it does not directly acknowledge or reflect the user's detailed experience and feelings. The language used is somewhat clinical and vague, with terms like ""تقلبات كبيرة في مستويات تعاطفك"" and ""زيادة درجة انخفاض الكيرالين"" that are unclear or possibly inaccurate, which may confuse the user rather than provide clarity. Empathy and validation are limited; the assistant acknowledges the user's effort to communicate and seek help but does not deeply validate the distress or normalize the experience of panic symptoms. Safety is partially addressed by recommending professional consultation, but the response does not explicitly advise urgent medical evaluation given the physical symptoms (e.g., chest and facial numbness) that could indicate a medical emergency. The tone is neutral but lacks warmth and encouragement, and it does not provide guidance on how to talk to the user's parent, which was a key part of the user's question. Boundaries are somewhat maintained by suggesting professional help, but the response could be clearer about its informational role. The holistic approach is limited; the assistant touches on social support at work but does not explore emotional coping strategies or the user's concerns about communicating with family. Overall, the response needs improvement in clarity, empathy, and practical guidance to fully meet the user's needs.",6,7,7,5,7,6,6,6,"The response acknowledges the user's experience but quickly jumps to a serious diagnosis (requiring a psychiatrist), which may be premature and alarming. It does validate the user's feelings and encourages seeking help, but the initial diagnostic statement overshadows these positive aspects. Some of the advice appears generic and potentially irrelevant (""الأناقة في إدارة مزاجك مؤقتًا""), reducing clarity.",5.5,5.5,5.5,5.5,7.0,5.0,6.0,5.0

It acknowledges the seriousness of the situation and encourages seeking professional help, which is appropriate and responsible. However, the response could improve in explicitly validating the user's feelings and fears, as well as clarifying the assistant’s role as an informational resource rather than a substitute for professional care. Some phrasing is slightly awkward or unclear, which affects clarity. The response touches on multiple aspects of the issue, including mental health, substance use, and coping strategies, but could be more holistic by addressing the user's self-perception and fears more directly.

It validates the user's feelings without minimizing them and acknowledges the difficulty of re-engaging with emotions. The assistant provides clear, gentle encouragement to take small steps toward emotional expression and emphasizes that healing is a gradual process. The response also prioritizes safety by advising the user to seek support if overwhelmed, which adds trustworthiness. It maintains a non-judgmental tone throughout and respects the user's current coping strategy while gently suggesting alternatives.
